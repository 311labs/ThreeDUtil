ThreeDUtil
==========

The start to some simple 3D mesh manipulation.  Right now we only support wavefront obj+mtl+textures.  You can scale, trans, clip, extract sub meshes, etc.


TODO
======

 - Switch to numpy for faster vertice calculations
 - Add support for scipy and face + edge detection
 - Add shortest path detection along edges
